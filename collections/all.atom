<p data-mce-fragment="1">Total Sweet is Europe’s leading brand of natural xylitol and is made from sustainable European birch and beech wood. Xylitol looks, feels and tastes like sugar and can be used in cooking or to sweeten hot drinks, fruit or cereal - just like the real thing</p>
<br data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Total Sweet Xylitol has 40% less calories than sugar, significantly less ‘available’ carbohydrates and a GI value of just 7 - nearly ten times lower than sugar. Xylitol makes it the perfect dieting companion, and an easy way for people to consume less sugar. Furthermore, it actively helps to promote healthy teeth</p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Total Sweet Xylitol offers steady energy release</b>: It has less ‘available’ carbohydrates (those absorbed and used by the body) and 40% less calories compared to normal sugar. It has the lowest GI value of all sugar alternatives on the market and is about 10 times lower than sugar. This means it doesn’t affect your blood sugar levels as dramatically as sugar does</p>
<br data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Total Sweet Xylitol promotes healthy teeth:</b><span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span>Xylitol is already an ingredient in many chewing gums, toothpastes, mints and mouth washes for its dental benefits. It can help to create an alkaline environment in the mouth, which can help reduce cavities and prevent plaque build-up. It can also help the mouth absorb calcium and other minerals that help your teeth stay strong and healthy</p>
